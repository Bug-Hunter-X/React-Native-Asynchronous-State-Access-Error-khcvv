# React Native Asynchronous State Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications where you attempt to access a property of a state variable before it has been assigned a value. This typically occurs when using asynchronous operations (like API calls) to update state.  The component may render before the state is fully populated, leading to a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '...')`.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the error in the console and app UI.

## Solution

The solution involves checking for null or undefined values before accessing the properties of the state variable.  Conditional rendering or optional chaining can be employed to gracefully handle this situation, preventing the error from occurring.
