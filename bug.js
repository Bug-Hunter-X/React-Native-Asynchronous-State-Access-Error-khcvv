This error occurs when you try to access a property of a state variable before it has been assigned a value. This commonly happens when you're using asynchronous operations, like fetching data from an API, to populate your state.  Because the state update happens asynchronously, the component may try to render before the state is ready, leading to the error. For instance, consider this code:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> {/* Error here if data is null */}
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, `data.name` might be accessed before the `fetch` call completes and updates the `data` state. If `data` is still `null` at render time, trying to access `data.name` results in a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')`.
